`VRPy` Documentation
====================

`VRPy` is a python framework for solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) including:

-   the Capacitated VRP (CVRP),
-   the CVRP with resource constraints,
-   the CVRP with time windows (CVRPTW),
-   the CVRP with simultaneous distribution and collection.

Check out section :ref:`vrp` to find more variants and options.

`VRPy` relies on the well known NetworkX_ package (graph manipulation), as well as on cspy_, a library of resource constrained shortest path algorithms.
